## An abstract toy model for replication

## Table of Contents

## Introduction
Self replication is an attribute of any system to duplicate and produce an identical copy. I try to build an Ising based lattice model for replication inspired by Michael Brenner's colloidal cluster replication simulation setup.  
Below you’ll see:

- An overview of the model  
- A few results  

## Interactions Overview-Hamiltonian
We use a 2D grid of spins with a fixed spin structure at a specified position in the grid. The Hamiltonian for
this system is the well-known 2D Ising Hamiltonian, with three types of interactions involved:  
(i) interaction of spins part of the fixed structure,  
(ii) interaction between two dynamic spins, and  
(iii) interaction between spins part of the fixed structure and a dynamic spin.  

From hereforth, a dynamic spin is labelled as ‘D’ and a fixed spin as ‘F’. (Dynamic spins flip constantly, fixed spins do not flip.)  

The Ising Hamiltonian:  
$$
H = \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} J_{ij} S_i S_j
$$
