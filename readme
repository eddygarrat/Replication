## Introduction
Self replication is an attribute of any system to duplicate an produce an identical copy. I try to build a Isling based lattice model for replication Inspired from Micheal Brenner Colloidal cluster replication simulation setup
 Below you 'll see

 * An overview of the model
 * a few results
## Interactions Overview-Hamitonian
We use a 2D grid of spins with a fixed spin structure at a specified position in the Grid.The Hamiltonian for
this system is the well known 2D isling Hamiltonian, with three types of interactions being involved. Those
are (i) interaction of spins part of the fixed structure ,(ii) interaction between two dynamic spins and (iii)
interaction between spins part of the fixed structure and a dynamic spin.From hereforth a dynamic spin is
labelled as ’D’ and a fixed spin is labelled as ’F’.( Dynamic in the sense that these spin flip constntly whereas
the Fixed in the sense that they do not flip at all)
the isling Hamiltonian: H = ∑[i,j] Jij SiSj
